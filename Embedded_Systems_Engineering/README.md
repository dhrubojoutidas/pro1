# CMPE3001 – Embedded Systems Engineering

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains my major assessments for **CMPE3001 (Embedded Systems Engineering)** at Curtin University.  
Across three assignments, I worked through the embedded systems lifecycle—from **market and feasibility analysis** to **engineering design decisions and implementation planning**.

The focus is on demonstrating practical engineering thinking: **requirements → trade-offs → cost/market feasibility → documented decisions**.

## 📁 Assessments Overview

### 1) [Market Research & Costing Plan – Smart Vending System](./Market_Reserch_Project.pdf)

This report evaluates the **vending machine industry** and develops a feasible business concept for a **smart vending solution** that provides **sanitary and personal hygiene products** in high-traffic locations (e.g., universities, workplaces, shopping centres, transport hubs).


The goal was to justify the idea using market evidence and structured business analysis—similar to early-stage product validation before engineering build.

**Key focus areas:**
- Industry and environmental analysis (PEST & industry trends)
- Competitor analysis and market positioning
- Competitor analysis (key players, strengths/weaknesses, market positioning)
- Product/service definition and target customer value
- Pricing strategy with sales/cost/profit calculations
- SWOT analysis and documented references
