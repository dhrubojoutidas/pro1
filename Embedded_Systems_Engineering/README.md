# CMPE3001 – Embedded Systems Engineering

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains my major assessments for **CMPE3001 (Embedded Systems Engineering)** at Curtin University.  
Across three assignments, I worked through the embedded systems lifecycle—from **market and feasibility analysis** to **engineering design decisions and implementation planning**.

The focus is on demonstrating practical engineering thinking: **requirements → trade-offs → cost/market feasibility → documented decisions**.

## 📁 Assessments Overview

### 1) [Market Research & Costing Plan – Smart Vending System](./Market_Reserch_Project.pdf)

This report evaluates the **vending machine industry** and develops a feasible business concept for a **smart vending solution** providing **sanitary and personal hygiene products** in high-traffic locations (e.g., universities, workplaces, shopping centres, and transport hubs).

The objective was to assess **commercial viability and feasibility** using market evidence and structured business analysis, similar to early-stage product validation prior to engineering implementation.

**Key focus areas:**
- Industry and environmental analysis (PEST & industry trends)
- Competitor analysis and market positioning
- Product/service definition and customer value proposition
- Pricing strategy with cost, markup, and profit calculations
- SWOT  (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis supported by academic and industry references
