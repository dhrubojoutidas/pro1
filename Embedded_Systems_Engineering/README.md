# CMPE3001 – Embedded Systems Engineering

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains my major assessments for **CMPE3001 (Embedded Systems Engineering)** at Curtin University.  
Across three assignments, I worked through the embedded systems lifecycle—from **market and feasibility analysis** to **engineering design decisions and implementation planning**.

The focus is on demonstrating practical engineering thinking: **requirements → trade-offs → cost/market feasibility → documented decisions**.
