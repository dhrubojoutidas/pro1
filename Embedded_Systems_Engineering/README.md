# CMPE3001 – Embedded Systems Engineering

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains my major assessments for **CMPE3001 (Embedded Systems Engineering)** at Curtin University.  
Across three assignments, I worked through the embedded systems lifecycle—from **market and feasibility analysis** to **engineering design decisions and implementation planning**.

The focus is on demonstrating practical engineering thinking: **requirements → trade-offs → cost/market feasibility → documented decisions**.

## 📁 Assessments Overview

### 1) [Market Research & Costing Plan – Smart Vending System](./Market_Reserch_Project.pdf)

This report evaluates the **vending machine industry** and develops a feasible business concept for a **smart vending solution** providing **sanitary and personal hygiene products** in high-traffic locations (e.g., universities, workplaces, shopping centres, and transport hubs).

The objective was to assess **commercial viability and feasibility** using market evidence and structured business analysis, similar to early-stage product validation prior to engineering implementation.

**Key focus areas:**
- Industry and environmental analysis (PEST & industry trends)
- Competitor analysis and market positioning
- Product/service definition and customer value proposition
- Pricing strategy with cost, markup, and profit calculations
- SWOT  (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis supported by academic and industry references


 ### 2) [Embedded Systems Fundamentals – MSP430 (Energia IDE)]((./LAB1_Getting%20Started%20with%20Energia%20and%20MSP430%20Experimenter%E2%80%99s%20Board%20.pdf)

This assignment involved implementing a series of **hands-on embedded system tasks** using the **MSP430FR5739 microcontroller**, focusing on the fundamentals of **firmware development and hardware interaction**.

The work progressed from basic digital I/O control to more advanced concepts such as **interrupt handling, PWM-based actuator control, and analog sensor interfacing**, reflecting the core building blocks used in real embedded systems.

The project emphasised understanding how software interacts with hardware at a low level, including timing, signal control, and responsiveness to external events.


**Key skills and concepts demonstrated:**
- Embedded programming in **C/C++** using the **Energia (Arduino-style) framework**
- GPIO configuration and LED control (including round-robin sequencing)
- **Interrupt-driven programming** for push-button inputs
- **PWM signal generation** for servo motor control
- **Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)** for reading onboard temperature sensors
- Timing and control using microcontroller peripherals
- Hardware–software integration and debugging on physical boards
- Writing clear technical documentation and structured lab reports



### 3) [Embedded Systems Laboratory Project – MSP430 & Arduino (Energiaa]((./Embedded%20Systems%20lab%20workduring%20lab%20session.pdf)


This laboratory project involved completing a series of **supervised, hands-on embedded systems tasks** using the **MSP430FR5739 Experimenter Board** and **Energia IDE**, focusing on practical interaction between software and hardware components.

Although the final modified source code from the lab sessions was not retained, the tasks were completed, demonstrated, and explained during the laboratory assessments. The work required understanding, implementing, and justifying embedded system behaviour in real time.

**Core tasks completed and demonstrated:**
- Programming the MSP430 to output data to the serial monitor
- Interfacing a **servo motor** and controlling its motion based on **temperature thresholds**
- Reading onboard **temperature sensor data** and reacting to environmental changes
- Using the onboard **accelerometer** and mapping axis data to LED outputs
- Implementing **calibration logic** using push buttons to reset sensor baselines
- Combining multiple functionalities into a **mode-based embedded program**
- Switching operating modes using hardware buttons with serial feedback
- Establishing **SPI communication between MSP430 and Arduino**
- Sending strings and control signals from MSP430 to Arduino and displaying output on an **I2C LCD**

**Technical concepts applied:**
- Embedded C/C++ programming using Energia
- GPIO control and digital output mapping
- Interrupt-driven input handling
- PWM-based servo control
- ADC usage for sensor input
- SPI and I2C communication protocols
- Hardware–software integration and debugging
- Real-time explanation and justification of embedded behaviour during lab demonstrations
