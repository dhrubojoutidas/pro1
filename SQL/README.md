# 🏅 Olympic Games Data Project

Hi, welcome to my project!  
Here I demonstrate how I worked with **Olympic Games data** using both **SQL** and **Python**.

To make the project easy to understand, I have organized everything into three main files:

---

## 📂 Project Files

✔️ **Report.pdf**  
Shows the results with explanations and screenshots of queries and outputs.

✔️ **User_Guide_to_implement**  
Step-by-step guide for users on how to start, what to do, and how to run SQL & Python queries.

✔️ **dbs_olympic_dataset**  
Contains both SQL and Python files to run the code and reproduce the analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Start by reading **User_Guide_to_implement** to understand the workflow.  
2. Explore **dbs_olympic_dataset** for the actual SQL and Python scripts.  
3. Check **Report.pdf** to see the results and screenshots of the implementation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (for querying and analyzing Olympic dataset)
- Python (for data processing and visualization)

---

## 📌 Notes
- This project is designed for learning and demonstration purposes.  
- Feel free to fork, modify, and experiment with the dataset and queries.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Thanks for checking out my project! I hope it helps you understand how SQL and Python can be combined for data analysis.
