# 📘 MATH1019: Linear Algebra and Statistics for Engineers

This repository contains my work for **Curtin University’s MATH1019** unit, completed in **Semester 2, 2023**. It includes lecture notes, code implementations, and a featured **statistics-based origami assignment** that demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

### **Unit Description**
This unit introduces fundamental concepts of **Linear Algebra** and **Statistics** for engineering applications. Topics include:

#### Linear Algebra:
- Vectors, lines, and planes in n-dimensional space  
- Matrix operations, inverses, determinants  
- Solving systems of linear equations (Gaussian elimination, Cramer’s rule)  
- Vector spaces and transformations  

#### Statistics:
- Descriptive and inferential statistics  
- Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal)  
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
