# 📐 MATH1019: Linear Algebra and Statistics for Engineers

This repository contains my work for **Curtin University’s MATH1019** unit, completed in **Semester 2, 2023** for engineering applications. Topics include:

### Linear Algebra:
- Vectors, lines, and planes in n-dimensional space  
- Matrix operations, inverses, determinants  
- Solving systems of linear equations (Gaussian elimination, Cramer’s rule)  
- Vector spaces and transformations  

### Statistics:
- Descriptive and inferential statistics  
- Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal)  
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

## 🏆 Featured Assignment: Origami & Statistics
This unique project combined **origami construction** with **statistical analysis**:
- Created 6 origami squares (190 mm side length) from recycled paper  
- Collected measurements (24 data points)  
- Built **histogram**, **box plot**, and a **Datasaurus-style visualization**  
- Performed:
  - Mean & standard deviation calculations  
  - Confidence intervals (90%, 99%)  
  - Hypothesis testing at 5% significance  
- Constructed origami models: Tyrannosaurus, star box, hyperbolic parabola
