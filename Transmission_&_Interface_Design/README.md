# [💻 Arduino Coding Folder — What It Contains & Why It Matters](./Arduino)

This folder contains all the **Arduino `.ino` programs** used to implement and test the communication protocols explored in **Lab 5: RS232, I²C, and SPI Interfaces**.  
These files demonstrate how microcontrollers communicate using different serial standards and how timing, addressing, and data integrity behave in real embedded systems.

## **📂 Part 1 — I²C Communication (Master & Slave)**  
Includes:  
- `Blink_I2C_Master.ino`  
- `Blink_I2C_Slave.ino`  
- `Blink_I2C_Master_2.ino`

**What this part shows:**  
- How a master sends commands over the I²C bus  
- How a slave responds using its assigned address  
- Multi‑slave communication using different addresses  
- LED control and bus behaviour when SDA/SCL are disconnected  

This demonstrates your understanding of **addressing, pull‑ups, synchronous communication, and multi‑device bus design**.

## **📂 Part 2 — RS232 → I²C Bridge (Serial to I²C)**  
Includes:  
- `Serial_I2C_Master.ino`  
- `Serial_I2C_Slave.ino`

**What this part shows:**  
- Receiving text from a PC via Serial (RS232‑style USB)  
- Forwarding that data over I²C to another Arduino  
- Slave printing the received data to Serial Monitor  
- How software delays affect timing and message flow  

This demonstrates your ability to **bridge two different communication standards** and manage timing between asynchronous and synchronous protocols.

## **📂 Part 3 — SPI Communication (High‑Speed Master & Slave)**  
Includes:  
- `SPI_Master.ino`  
- `SPI_Slave.ino`

**What this part shows:**  
- Full‑duplex SPI communication using MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS  
- Slave receiving data via SPI interrupt (`SPI_STC_vect`)  
- Testing different SPI clock speeds:  
  - `DIV32` → slow & stable  
  - `DIV8` → fast & reliable  
  - `DIV2` → very fast, causes corrupted data  
- How timing limits affect data integrity  

This demonstrates your understanding of **high‑speed serial buses, interrupt‑driven communication, and hardware timing constraints**.
