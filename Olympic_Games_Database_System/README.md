# Olympic Games Database System (SQL & Python)

This project was completed as part of a **Database Systems unit** at Curtin University and demonstrates the **design, implementation, and use of a relational database**, integrated with **Python** for dynamic data access.

The system models real-world data from the **Olympic Games**, including athletes, teams, events, schedules, coaches, and medal results.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

The project involved:
- Designing an **Entity–Relationship (ER) model** and relational schema
- Implementing the database in **MySQL**
- Loading and querying real-world style data
- Using **advanced SQL features** (joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures)
- Connecting the database to **Python** for programmatic querying

An ER diagram is included to illustrate the database structure and relationships.

## 🗄️ Technologies Used
- **MySQL 8.0**
- **SQL** (DDL, DML, joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures)
- **Python 3** (MySQL Connector)
- Linux environment (VMware)
