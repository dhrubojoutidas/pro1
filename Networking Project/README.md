# Data Communications & Network Management (CMPE2000)

This repository contains a **group-based networking project** completed for the **CMPE2000 – Data Communications and Network Management** unit at Curtin University.

The project demonstrates practical experience in **network design, routing, VLAN implementation, IP addressing, and network simulation** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, aligned with real-world enterprise networking concepts.

---

## 📡 Project Overview

The assignment was completed in **three stages**, progressing from basic concepts to a full enterprise-style network design.

### 🔹 Stage 1 – Network Topologies
- Designed and analysed **Star, Bus, and Ring topologies**
- Compared performance, scalability, cost, and reliability
- Evaluated real-world use cases for each topology

### 🔹 Stage 2 – Routing Protocol Implementation
- Configured **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** across three routers
- Enabled communication between multiple LANs
- Analysed routing behaviour and limitations of RIP

### 🔹 Stage 3 – Enterprise LAN Design (Main Project)
- Designed a **hierarchical LAN** for an academic building
- Supported **~180 users** across multiple departments
- Implemented:
  - VLAN segmentation (Business, IT, Support, Students/Staff)
  - Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
  - 802.1Q trunking
  - Static IP addressing with **VLSM**
  - Basic network security considerations
- Fully simulated and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer**
