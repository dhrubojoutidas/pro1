# Data Communications & Network Management (CMPE2000)

This repository contains a **group-based networking project** completed for the **CMPE2000 – Data Communications and Network Management** unit at Curtin University.

---

## 📡 Project Overview

The assignment was completed in **three stages**, progressing from basic concepts to a full enterprise-style network design.

### 🔹 Stage 1 – Network Topologies
- Designed and analysed **Star, Bus, and Ring topologies**
- Compared performance, scalability, cost, and reliability
- Evaluated real-world use cases for each topology

###  🧪 **[Project 2 – Routing Protocol Implementation](./Final%20packetTracer_2.pkt)**
  
- Configured **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** across three routers acket Tracer
- Enabled communication between multiple LANs
- Analysed routing behaviour and limitations of RIP
