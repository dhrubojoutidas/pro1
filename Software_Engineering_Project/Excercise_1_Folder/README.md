## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains **Exercise Submission 1**, focused on **software requirement analysis**, **project planning**, and **version control strategy** for an airline reservation system called **SkyFly**.

The project demonstrates skills in:

* Requirements engineering
* Actor + user story modelling
* UML use case diagrams
* AON/PERT project scheduling
* Critical path identification
* Non-functional requirement specification
* Git version control planning

## ✅ 1. Planning & Scheduling

### **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
A detailed WBS was created to break the SkyFly system into manageable components, including:  
- User management  
- Passenger information handling  
- Flight search & scheduling  
- Seat allocation  
- Ticketing & cancellation  
- Payment & billing  
- Notifications & updates  
- Reservation enquiries  
- Technical support

## ✅ 2. Functional Requirement Analysis

### **Actors Identified**
- Passengers  
- Pilots / Crew  
- Front Desk Representatives  
- Admin / Management Staff  
- Database System  
- Payment Gateway Service

### **User Stories (10+)**

Includes stories from the perspective of passengers, agents, admins, database, and payment systems.

### **Use Cases**
Four detailed use cases were developed, including:  
- Managing seating arrangements  
- Processing refunds  
- Accessing passenger details  
- Downloading boarding passes  

Each use case includes:  
✅ Goal  
✅ Actors  
✅ Preconditions  
✅ Triggers  
✅ Flow of Events  
✅ Extensions  

 ### **UML Use Case Diagram**  
A complete UML diagram shows all actors and system interactions.

- Accessibility features (screen reader, multi‑language support)

### **Performance Requirements**
- Payment processing < 4 seconds  
- Page load < 4 seconds  
- System handles high user volume  

### **Reliability Requirements**
- 99.99% availability for user registration  
-  Backup and error-handling mechanisms

## 🌿 5. Version Control Strategy (Git)

### **Branches**

| Branch        | Purpose                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `main`        | Stable, final version                 |
| `development` | Latest updates, weekly merges                     |
| `feature-*`   | Individual features from user stories |



### **Workflow Summary**

* Create `main` + `development` on Day 1
* Create feature branches for major milestones
* Merge to `development` weekly or after tasks completed
* Merge `development` → `main` after final review
