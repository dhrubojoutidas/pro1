## ✅ 1. Planning & Scheduling

### **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
A detailed WBS was created to break the SkyFly system into manageable components, including:  
- User management  
- Passenger information handling  
- Flight search & scheduling  
- Seat allocation  
- Ticketing & cancellation  
- Payment & billing  
- Notifications & updates  
- Reservation enquiries  
- Technical support

### **AON, PERT & Critical Path Analysis**

The submission includes:

* Activity-on-Node (AON) network
* Dependencies & task durations
* ES, EF, LS, LF calculations
* Slack identification
* **Critical Path identified: 54 weeks**
* **PERT expected duration: 52.13 weeks**

# ✅ 2. Functional Requirement Analysis

### **Actors Identified**

* Passenger
* Pilot / Cabin Crew
* Front-desk Representative
* Admin / Management Staff
* Database System
* Payment Gateway

---

### **User Stories (10+)**

User stories were created from multiple perspectives, including passengers, staff, admin, and system components.

---

### **Use Cases (4 detailed)**

Use cases include:

1. Seat arrangement management
2. Refund processing
3. Accessing passenger details
4. Downloading boarding passes

Each use case contains:

* Goals
* Actors
* Preconditions
* Triggers
* Main flow
* Extensions

## ⚙️ 3. Non‑Functional Requirements

### **Usability Requirements**
- User‑friendly interface  
- Quick access to flight information  
- Accessibility features (screen reader, multi‑language support)

### **Performance Requirements**
- Payment processing < 4 seconds  
- Page load < 4 seconds  
- System handles high user volume  

### **Reliability Requirements**
- 99.99% availability for user registration  
-  Backup and error-handling mechanisms
-  Ticket printing failure < 0.1%

# 🌿 4. Version Control Strategy (Git)

### **Branching Structure**

| Branch        | Purpose                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `main`        | Stable production version            |
| `development` | Active weekly updates                |
| `feature-*`   | One branch per user story or feature |

---

### **Git Workflow Summary**

1. Create `main` and `development` branches
2. Create `feature-*` branches for each major task
3. Commit changes and merge into `development` regularly
4. Merge `development` → `main` after final review and testing
