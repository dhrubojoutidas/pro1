# Engineering Management – Academic Projects Portfolio

This folder contains **three major Engineering Management assignments** completed as part of my undergraduate engineering studies at Curtin University.  
Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to apply **engineering management, project planning, sustainability thinking, and organisational analysis** to real-world engineering problems.

Rather than theoretical exercises, these assignments focus on **practical decision-making, structured planning, risk management, and professional documentation**—skills directly transferable to industry roles.

## 📘 Assignment 1 – Sustainable Product Concept & Project Charter

### Overview  
This assignment focuses on proposing and planning a **sustainable engineering project**:  
**a scalable production system for manufacturing eco-friendly furniture from reclaimed wooden pallets**.

The work is split into two parts:

### Part 1 – Product Concept & Rationale  
- Defined a **commercially viable recycled product**
- Analysed environmental, social, and economic benefits
- Explained how waste materials are transformed into a usable product
- Evaluated market demand and innovation potential

**Skills demonstrated**
- Sustainability analysis  
- Engineering reasoning & feasibility assessment  
- Technical writing and research  

---

### Part 2 – Project Charter & Production System Planning  
- Developed a full **project charter** for scaling production
- Defined project scope, objectives, deliverables, exclusions, and risks
- Created:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - Indicative schedule and budget
  - Risk register and mitigation strategies
  - Milestones and resource allocation

This mirrors how **real engineering projects are approved and executed in industry**.

**Skills demonstrated**
- Project management fundamentals (scope, cost, time, risk)
- Systems thinking and production planning
- Professional engineering documentation

## 📗 Assignment 2 – Engineering Communication & Peer Review

### Overview  
This assignment focused on **communicating engineering ideas clearly and professionally**.

It included:
- A short **technical video presentation** explaining the project concept and production system
- A **project diagram** illustrating the manufacturing workflow
- Providing **structured, constructive feedback** on other engineering projects

**Skills demonstrated**
- Technical communication
- Visual explanation of complex systems
- Critical evaluation and professional feedback
- Stakeholder-focused presentation skills

## 📙 Assignment 3 – Team-Based Engineering Project Management

### Overview  
This was a **group-based engineering management project** that simulated working in a professional engineering team.

The assignment required:
- Forming and managing a project team
- Assigning roles (Project Manager, Secretary, DTR)
- Conducting formal meetings with recorded minutes
- Developing:
  - Communication management plans
  - Document control and versioning
  - Scheduling and progress tracking
  - Organisational structure and responsibilities

The project followed the **full project lifecycle**, from initiation to close-out.

**Skills demonstrated**
- Team leadership and collaboration
- Engineering documentation standards
- Organisational planning
- Real-world project coordination

## 🧠 Key Takeaways for Recruiters

Across these three assignments, I demonstrated:

- Practical application of **engineering management principles**
- Ability to plan, document, and communicate complex projects
- Strong understanding of **sustainability and systems thinking**
- Experience working both **independently and in teams**
- Professional-level reporting, structure, and version control

These projects reflect how I approach engineering problems in a **structured, analytical, and industry-ready manner**.
