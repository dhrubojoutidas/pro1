  ## 🧩 Software Engineering – Git & Version Control Practice

As part of my Software Engineering course, I maintained a separate Git-focused repository where I practiced:

- branching, merging, and conflict resolution  
- tagging and archiving versions  
- visualising commit history using `git log --decorate --graph --all`  
- documenting workshop sheets, lecture notes, and commit logs  

📁 [You can view that Git practice repo here: ](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac.git)

It includes:
- [full commit history exported as a `.txt` file](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/Workshop%204_ISEN_2.txt)
- python file [Maze.py](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/Maze.py) & [Viwer.py](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/Viewer.py)
- [Original python file](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/Maze_REAL.py)
- [workshop exercises PDF](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/ISEN1000%20Workshop%2004%20-%20Version%20Control.pdf) 
- [README explaining each Git concept ](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/README.md)
- [Git pdf Note](https://github.com/dhrubojoutidas/git_workshop4_prac/blob/master/PAGE%201%20Version%20Control%20Notes.pdf)


This complements the work in this main repo and shows my hands-on understanding of version control.

 ## 🔐 Cybersecurity & Information Security Foundations

The following concepts were studied through **Cisco CyberOps Associate**, **network security coursework**, and **academic labs**, and are applied conceptually across networking, systems, and cloud-based projects in this repository.

---

### 🧱 Core Security Principles
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (**CIA Triad**)
- Authentication, Authorization & Access Control
- Least Privilege & Separation of Duties (**SoD**)
- Defense-in-Depth
- Security Policy vs Security Model
- Security Awareness & User Training

---

### ⚠️ Risk, Threats & Governance
- Threat, Vulnerability, Risk & Incident lifecycle
- Risk Identification, Assessment & Mitigation
- Qualitative vs Quantitative Risk Analysis
- Cost–Benefit Analysis (**CBA**)
- **SLE**, **ARO**, **ALE** (Annualized Loss Expectancy)
- Change Management & Asset Valuation (Tangible vs Intangible)

---

### 🎯 Common Attacks & Threat Vectors
- Social Engineering (Phishing, Spear Phishing, Whaling)
- Malware & Ransomware concepts
- SQL Injection
- Data Exfiltration & Data Leakage
- Distributed Denial-of-Service (**DDoS**)
