# COMP2000 – Computer Systems  
### IT Infrastructure Design Project

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project involved designing a **complete IT infrastructure** for a real-world company as part of the COMP2000 (Computer Systems) unit at Curtin University.

I analysed **Menu Butler Pty Ltd**, a Perth-based software company, and produced a practical IT system design that supports its business operations across multiple departments and locations.

The outcome reflects the responsibilities of a **junior system administrator / IT support professional** in a real organisation.

- **Perth CBD** – Software development, R&D, design, client relations
